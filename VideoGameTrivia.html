				The video game industry, as we know it today , has been evolving over many years (officially from 1971 to present) .  (There are notable skips in the fourth to seventh generation, due to the limitation of holding this topic brief and this summary will not specify the specific states of the PC gaming advances, as a result of being a summary of the console history)

				The first generation of video games (1972-1977 or 1972-1980 in Japan) started with the Magnavox Odyssey,
					
				which could only cast three square blocks on the television and therefore was package with extra accessory (such as television overlays). The first generation otherwise of the Odyssey series consisted only of Pong Machines and ended with their disappearance during the video game crash of 1977.  These consoles were only capable of playing the specific amount of games that there included 				
				in their hardware. In the case of the "pong consoles" the games have been hard coded into the hardware and were activated trough logic gates, while the Odyssey had cartridges that activated the games that were wired into the console (And trough that these cartrigdes had the function of "jumpers").

				The second generation of video games (1976-1992) started with the Fairchild VES, which was the first CPU based video game console.

					</div>The Games now consisted of microprocessor-based code that were burned on ROM Chips that wereand then were cased in a plastic cartridge. These when plugged in the consoles contacts, will be able to have their stored data on the cartridge read by the general purpose 
				microprocessor and run on the console.  The most notorious console of the second generation is the Atari 2600. The theoretical end of the second generation was in 1992, but because of the start of the third generation in 1983, with the infamous video game crash in 1983 and the release of the very successful NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) that fact could be labeled obsolete.

				The Third generation started with the release of the Nintendo  Famicom (and later NES (Nintendo entertainment system)) in 1983. This
				generation still seems to be commonly remembered, this is probably due to the Objectively superior games, which could be granted trough the technological advances that have been made and the revolutionary game design of this games (although their have been very good designed games prevesly (such as Space Invaders), their could not compete with the design of the, in comparison vastly more complex,  games starting with this generation ),  , in fact so superior that most of this game design choices are commonly used to this day.

				Beginning with the fifth generation almost every console has used some form of optical disc (examples  would be DVD, CD and beginning

					</div> with the seventh generation the blue-ray), where the N64 was the only exception. Even though most of the console of the fourth generation could have an optical disc drive, they were not included in the original release of the console and thus these needed to be purchased separately from the origin console.   These optical disc enabled generally more data space and were commonly able to save data on the disc, which means that you could create a save data and load these to continue from were you left off.  But these optical disc bear a great disadvantage, because these cannot be read as fast as the processing device theoretically could,  which resulted in long loading times.  Starting with the seventh

						<div id="imagePS4"></div>
						A picture of the PS4 System
					</div>generation the consoles did not only had a similar build to a PC, it also started to compensated the disadvantage of  optical disc with a installment of the software (This does not apply to every game of the seventh
					<div class="textPicture">
						<div id="imagePSOne"></div>
						A picture of the PSOne System
					</div> generation).  In the eight generation that trend was only took further, because the console build generally consisted of a common PC build and while in the seventh generation some games were partly to completely installed (most commonly with additional updates via internet), the eighth generation requires every game, that has a retail release, to
					 be fully installed.  After that the disc is required to start the Software (making it basically a key).  Giving these circumstances the option of streaming a video game might be more desirable, because it whether require instalments of that big size nor has it the price of a retail game, even though this means that your game licenses are not of much worth.
